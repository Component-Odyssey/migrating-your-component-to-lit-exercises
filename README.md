# Migrating Your Components to Lit: Exercises

The companion repo to the corresponding lesson from [Component Odyssey](https://component-odyssey.com).

## Getting started

Clone this repo using:

`git clone https://github.com/Component-Odyssey/migrating-your-component-to-lit-exercises.git`

Open the folder in VSCode

Navigate to the exercise directory:

`cd ./starter`

Install the dependencies:

`npm i`

Start the server:

`npm run start`

## Exercise

The aim of the exercise is to migate two components over to Lit. The components are:

- `album-art`
- `image-carousel`

They're the same components that you built as vanilla web components in a previous lesson. Your job is to migrate them over to Lit.

Start by migrating the `album-art` component. The `starter/album-art.js` has the steps you need to complete the task.

Once you've successfully migrated the component and test that it's working move on to the `image-carousel` component.

This one is a little more complicated, but you should be able to complete it using the knowledge from the last few lessons.

## Resources

If you get stuck, or haven't memorised the Lit syntax, it's worth reviewing the following documentation:

- [Lit Properties](https://lit.dev/docs/components/properties/)
- [Lit Lifecycle Methods](https://lit.dev/docs/components/lifecycle/)
- [Lit Events](https://lit.dev/docs/components/events/)
